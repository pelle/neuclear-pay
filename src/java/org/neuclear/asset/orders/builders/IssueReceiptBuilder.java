$Log: IssueReceiptBuilder.java,v $
Revision 1.1  2004/04/06 16:24:34  pelle
Added two new Data Objects IssuerOrder and IssueReceipt for managing the issuance process.
Added Issuance support to the Asset and Audit Controllers.
Implemented access control for complete and cancel exchange orders.

Revision 1.4  2004/01/12 22:39:14  pelle
Completed all the builders and contracts.
Added a new abstract Value class to contain either an amount or a list of serial numbers.
Now ready to finish off the AssetControllers.

Revision 1.3  2004/01/11 00:39:06  pelle
Cleaned up the schemas even more they now all verifiy.
The Order/Receipt pairs for neuclear pay, should now work. They all have Readers using the latest
Schema.
The TransferBuilders are done and the ExchangeBuilders are nearly there.
The new EmbeddedSignedNamedObject builder is useful for creating new Receipts. The new ReceiptBuilder uses
this to create the embedded transaction.
ExchangeOrders now have the concept of BidItem's, you could create an ExchangeOrder bidding on various items at the same time, to be exchanged as one atomic multiparty exchange.
Still doesnt build yet, but very close now ;-)

Revision 1.2  2004/01/10 00:00:45  pelle
Implemented new Schema for Transfer*
Working on it for Exchange*, so far all Receipts are implemented.
Added SignedNamedDocument which is a generic SignedNamedObject that works with all Signed XML.
Changed SignedNamedObject.getDigest() from byte array to String.
The whole malarchy in neuclear-pay does not build yet. The refactoring is a big job, but getting there.

Revision 1.1  2004/01/05 23:47:09  pelle
Create new Document classification "order", which is really just inherint in the new
package layout.
Got rid of much of the inheritance that was lying around and thought a bit further about the format of the exchange orders.

Revision 1.5  2004/01/03 20:36:25  pelle
Renamed HeldTransfer to Exchange
Dropped valuetime from the request objects.
Doesnt yet compile. New commit to follow soon.

Revision 1.4  2003/11/21 04:43:03  pelle
EncryptedFileStore now works. It uses the PBECipher with DES3 afair.
Otherwise You will Finaliate.
Anything that can be final has been made final throughout everyting. We've used IDEA's Inspector tool to find all instance of variables that could be final.
This should hopefully make everything more stable (and secure).

Revision 1.3  2003/11/10 17:42:07  pelle
The AssetController interface has been more or less finalized.
CurrencyController fully implemented
AssetControlClient implementes a remote client for communicating with AssetControllers

Revision 1.2  2003/11/09 03:26:47  pelle
More house keeping and shuffling about mainly pay

Revision 1.1  2003/11/09 03:10:13  pelle
Major changes that apparently didnt get properly checked in earlier.

Revision 1.2  2003/11/06 23:47:43  pelle
Major Refactoring of CurrencyController.
Factored out AssetController to be new abstract parent class together with most of its support classes.
Created (Half way) AssetControlClient, which can perform transactions on external AssetControllers via NeuClear.
Created the first attempt at the ExchangeAgent. This will need use of the AssetControlClient.
SOAPTools was changed to return a stream. This is required by the VerifyingReader in NeuClear.

Revision 1.1  2003/10/03 23:48:29  pelle
Did various security related updates in the pay package with regards to immutability of fields etc.
AssetControllerReceiver should now be operational. Real testing needs to be done including in particular setting the
private key of the Receiver.
A new class TransferGlobals contains usefull settings for making life easier in the other contract based classes.
TransferContract the signed contract is functional and has a matching TransferRequestBuilder class for programmatically creating
TransferRequests for signing.
TransferReceiptBuilder has been created for use by Transfer processors. It is used in the AssetControllerReceiver.
