Revision 1.2  2003/11/21 04:43:04  pelle
EncryptedFileStore now works. It uses the PBECipher with DES3 afair.
Otherwise You will Finaliate.
Anything that can be final has been made final throughout everyting. We've used IDEA's Inspector tool to find all instance of variables that could be final.
This should hopefully make everything more stable (and secure).

Revision 1.1  2003/11/08 01:39:58  pelle
WARNING this rev is majorly unstable and will almost certainly not compile.
More major refactoring in neuclear-pay.
Got rid of neuclear-ledger like features of pay such as Account and Issuer.
Accounts have been replaced by Identity from neuclear-id
Issuer is now Asset which is a subclass of Identity
AssetController supports more than one Asset. Which is important for most non ecurrency implementations.
TransferRequest/Receipt and its Held companions are now SignedNamedObjects. Thus to create them you must use
their matching TransferRequest/ReceiptBuilder classes.
PaymentProcessor has been renamed CurrencyController. I will extract a superclass later to be named AbstractLedgerController
which will handle all neuclear-ledger based AssetControllers.
