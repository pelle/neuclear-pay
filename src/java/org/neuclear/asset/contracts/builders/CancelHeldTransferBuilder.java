$Log: CancelHeldTransferBuilder.java,v $
Revision 1.3  2003/11/12 23:47:04  pelle
Much work done in creating good test environment.
PaymentReceiverTest works, but needs a abit more work in its environment to succeed testing.

Revision 1.2  2003/11/11 21:17:19  pelle
Further vital reshuffling.
org.neudist.crypto.* and org.neudist.utils.* have been moved to respective areas under org.neuclear.commons
org.neuclear.signers.* as well as org.neuclear.passphraseagents have been moved under org.neuclear.commons.crypto as well.
Did a bit of work on the Canonicalizer and changed a few other minor bits.

Revision 1.1  2003/11/10 17:42:07  pelle
The AssetController interface has been more or less finalized.
CurrencyController fully implemented
AssetControlClient implementes a remote client for communicating with AssetControllers

Revision 1.2  2003/11/09 03:26:47  pelle
More house keeping and shuffling about mainly pay

Revision 1.1  2003/11/09 03:10:13  pelle
Major changes that apparently didnt get properly checked in earlier.

Revision 1.2  2003/11/06 23:47:43  pelle
Major Refactoring of CurrencyController.
Factored out AssetController to be new abstract parent class together with most of its support classes.
Created (Half way) AssetControlClient, which can perform transactions on external AssetControllers via NeuClear.
Created the first attempt at the ExchangeAgent. This will need use of the AssetControlClient.
SOAPTools was changed to return a stream. This is required by the VerifyingReader in NeuClear.

Revision 1.1  2003/10/03 23:48:29  pelle
Did various security related updates in the pay package with regards to immutability of fields etc.
AssetControllerReceiver should now be operational. Real testing needs to be done including in particular setting the
private key of the Receiver.
A new class TransferGlobals contains usefull settings for making life easier in the other contract based classes.
TransferContract the signed contract is functional and has a matching TransferRequestBuilder class for programmatically creating
TransferRequests for signing.
TransferReceiptBuilder has been created for use by Transfer processors. It is used in the AssetControllerReceiver.
