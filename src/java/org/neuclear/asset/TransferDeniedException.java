$Log: TransferDeniedException.java,v $
Revision 1.7  2004/01/10 00:00:45  pelle
Implemented new Schema for Transfer*
Working on it for Exchange*, so far all Receipts are implemented.
Added SignedNamedDocument which is a generic SignedNamedObject that works with all Signed XML.
Changed SignedNamedObject.getDigest() from byte array to String.
The whole malarchy in neuclear-pay does not build yet. The refactoring is a big job, but getting there.

Revision 1.6  2004/01/05 23:47:10  pelle
Create new Document classification "order", which is really just inherint in the new
package layout.
Got rid of much of the inheritance that was lying around and thought a bit further about the format of the exchange orders.

Revision 1.5  2004/01/03 20:36:26  pelle
Renamed HeldTransfer to Exchange
Dropped valuetime from the request objects.
Doesnt yet compile. New commit to follow soon.

Revision 1.4  2003/11/21 04:43:04  pelle
EncryptedFileStore now works. It uses the PBECipher with DES3 afair.
Otherwise You will Finaliate.
Anything that can be final has been made final throughout everyting. We've used IDEA's Inspector tool to find all instance of variables that could be final.
This should hopefully make everything more stable (and secure).

Revision 1.3  2003/11/10 17:42:07  pelle
The AssetController interface has been more or less finalized.
CurrencyController fully implemented
AssetControlClient implementes a remote client for communicating with AssetControllers

Revision 1.2  2003/11/08 01:39:58  pelle
WARNING this rev is majorly unstable and will almost certainly not compile.
More major refactoring in neuclear-pay.
Got rid of neuclear-ledger like features of pay such as Account and Issuer.
Accounts have been replaced by Identity from neuclear-id
Issuer is now Asset which is a subclass of Identity
AssetController supports more than one Asset. Which is important for most non ecurrency implementations.
TransferOrder/Receipt and its Exchange companions are now SignedNamedObjects. Thus to create them you must use
their matching TransferOrder/ReceiptBuilder classes.
PaymentProcessor has been renamed CurrencyController. I will extract a superclass later to be named AbstractLedgerController
which will handle all neuclear-ledger based AssetControllers.

Revision 1.1  2003/11/06 23:47:43  pelle
Major Refactoring of CurrencyController.
Factored out AssetController to be new abstract parent class together with most of its support classes.
Created (Half way) AssetControlClient, which can perform transactions on external AssetControllers via NeuClear.
Created the first attempt at the ExchangeAgent. This will need use of the AssetControlClient.
SOAPTools was changed to return a stream. This is required by the VerifyingReader in NeuClear.
