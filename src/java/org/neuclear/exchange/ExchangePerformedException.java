$Log: ExchangePerformedException.java,v $
Revision 1.1  2003/11/06 23:47:43  pelle
Major Refactoring of PaymentProcessor.
Factored out AssetController to be new abstract parent class together with most of its support classes.
Created (Half way) RemoteAssetController, which can perform transactions on external AssetControllers via NeuClear.
Created the first attempt at the ExchangeAgent. This will need use of the RemoteAssetController.
SOAPTools was changed to return a stream. This is required by the VerifyingReader in NeuClear.
