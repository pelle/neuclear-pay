                NeuClear Pay is the NeuClear API that concerns itself with Payments and other types of Asset Transfers.
                The main API in NeuClear PAY is <a href="apidocs/org/neuclear/asset/AssetController.html">AssetController</a>
                which presents all the basic functionality needed for
            </p>
            <p>
                A fully functional implementation of the AssetController  is implemented in
                <a href="apidocs/org/neuclear/asset/controllers/currency/CurrencyController.html">CurrencyController</a>.
                This works as a fully functioning Electronic Currency. Just add financial backing a governance model and
                you are in business.
                The CurrencyController is implemented on top of the <a href="http://neuclear.org/ledger/">NeuClear Ledger API</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Implementations based on other backends should be simple to create. If you wish to implement it ontop
                of an existing SQL ledger. We recommend extending the NeuClear Ledger instead of writing a completely new
                Payment Processor.
